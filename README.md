# Pixel-Converter
Pixel Converter for Rust Programming Language Class


#Layout of Project
There will be multiple files that will run the program. The main.rs file will take in an image from the command line and output a command-line menu
where the user will be able to pick and choose what alterations they want to have done to the image. Each of the alterations will be implemented
in different rust files and have functions that can be called from the main file. The output of the program will be another image with all of the
alterations done to it.
